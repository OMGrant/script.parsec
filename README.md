# OSMC/Kodi Addon: Parsec Launcher
Parsec is a game streaming application used to play video games remotely across a conntected network from a system in the cloud to your home computer. OSMC (short for Open Source Media Center) is a Linux distribution based on Debian that brings Kodi to a variety of devices. This addon brings the two together to create a seamless experience.

## Features
* Launch Parsec from OSMC/Kodi on your Raspberry Pi.
* Easily configure your Parsec connection from within the addon configuration menu.
* Automatically exit back into OSMC/Kodi after your Parsec session has ended.
* Seamlessly launch directly into your Parsec host without having to enter login or host selection information by enabling Headless Client Mode.
